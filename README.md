As a Machine Learning Research Intern at Design Innovation Centre (DIC) - Hub GTU, I have done a research project titled: 'Multimodal Alzheimer’s disease Classification Using MRI and Genetic Data' under the guidance of Dr.Neelesh Sharma.

Project Involved:

• Built a multimodal Alzheimer’s disease classification pipeline using ADNI-1 T1-weighted MRI and genetic SNPs
data for the 200 patients having both types of data modalities.

• Preprocessed MRI data using MONAI and NiBabel, genetic data using PLINK (MAF filtering, missing rate filtering, and LD pruning), PCA, and a noisy autoencoder for embedding extraction from genetic data.

• Fine-tuned MedicalNet 3D-ResNet50 for MRI feature learning and extracting embeddings, and performed multimodal fusion with Random
Forest, achieving effective integration of imaging and genetic modalities.
