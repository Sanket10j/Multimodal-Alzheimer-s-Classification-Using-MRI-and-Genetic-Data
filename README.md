As a Machine Learning Research Intern at Design Innovation Centre (DIC) - Hub GTU, I have done a research project titled: 'Multimodal Alzheimer’s disease Classification Using MRI and Genetic Data' under the guidance of Dr.Neelesh Sharma.

Project Involved:

• Built a multimodal Alzheimer’s disease classification pipeline using ADNI T1-weighted MRI and genetic SNP
data for early diagnostic prediction.

• Preprocessed MRI data using MONAI, genetic data using PLINK, PCA, and a noisy autoencoder for embedding
extraction.

• Fine-tuned MedicalNet 3D-ResNet50 for MRI feature learning and performed multimodal fusion with Random
Forest, achieving effective integration of imaging and genetic modalities.
